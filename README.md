# Introduction to R markdown
This is a general resource on how to use R markdown. It is designed to show how markdown is an effective way to archive your projects, code, and output. This primer is BASIC, as the power and possibilities of markdown are immense. Markdown will soon become your overlord, your best friend, your addiction.

### Download the repository
- once downloaded you can run the markdown (Rmd) file in R studio, as long as the directory is downloaded together
- you can view the output of the markdown as a pdf file. This shows what your markdown looks like as an exported document.
